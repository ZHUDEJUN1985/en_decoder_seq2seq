On
And
a
youth
said
Speak
to
us
of
Your
friend
is
your
needs
He
is
your
field
which
you
sow
with
love
and
reap
with
And
he
is
your
board
and
your
For
you
come
to
him
with
your
hunger
and
you
seek
him
for
peace
When
your
friend
speaks
his
mind
you
fear
not
the
nay
in
your
own
mind
nor
do
you
the
ay
And
when
he
is
silent
your
heart
ceases
not
to
listen
to
his
heart
For
words
in
all
all
all
are
born
and
shared
with
joy
that
is
When
you
part
from
your
friend
you
grieve
not
For
that
which
you
love
most
in
him
may
be
in
his
as
the
to
the
is
from
the
plain
And
let
there
be
no
in
save
the
of
the
spirit
For
love
that
seeks
aught
but
the
of
its
own
is
not
love
but
a
net
cast
forth
and
only
the
is
caught
And
let
your
best
be
for
your
friend
If
he
must
know
the
ebb
of
your
tide
let
him
know
its
flood
also
For
what
is
your
friend
that
you
should
seek
him
with
hours
to
kill
Seek
him
always
with
hours
to
live
For
it
is
his
to
fill
your
need
but
not
your
And
in
the

For
in
the
dew
of
little
things
the
heart
finds
its
and

The
story
goes
that
some
time
ago
a
man
his
year
old
for
a
roll
of
gold
paper
Money
was
tight
and
he
became
when
the
child
tried
to
a
box
to
put
under
the
tree
the
little
girl
the
gift
to
her
father
the
next
and
said
This
is
for
you
Daddy
The
man
was
by
his
but
his
anger
flared
again
when
he
found
out
the
box
was
empty
He
yelled
at
her
Do
not
you
know
when
you
give
a
there
is
to
be
inside
The
little
girl
looked
up
at
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
cried
Oh
Daddy
it
is
not
empty
at
all
I
blew
kisses
into
the
box
They
are
all
for
you
Daddy
The
father
was
He
put
his
arms
around
his
little
girl
and
he
begged
for
her
Only
a
short
time
later
an
took
the
life
of
the
child
It
is
also
told
that
her
father
kept
that
gold
box
by
his
bed
for
many
years
and
he
was
he
would
take
out
an
kiss
and
the
love
of
the
child
who
had
put
it
there
In
a
very
real
sense
each
one
of
us
as
humans
beings
have
been
given
a
gold
filled
with
love
and
kisses
from
our
family
and
God
There
is
simply
no
other
anyone
could
hold
more
than
this
the
woman
what
the
child
meant
and
why
she
was
crying
down
she
gently
the
child
in
her
arms
and
they
cried
for
the
mommy
that
was
gone
Then
the
little
girl
did
that
the
woman
was
a
bit
She
crying
back
from
the
woman
and
began
to
sing
She
sang
so
softly
that
it
was
almost
a
It
was
the
sound
the
woman
had
ever
heard
almost
like
the
song
of
a
very
small
bird
After
the
child
she
to
the
lady
My
mommy
used
to
sing
that
song
to
me
before
she
went
away
and
she
made
me
to
sing
it
I
crying
and
it
would
make
me
stop
to
a
spot
on
her
said
Right
here
is
where
my
mommy
kissed
my
dress
and
here
to
spot
and
here
is
kiss
and
here
and
here
Mommy
said
that
she
put
all
those
kisses
on
my
dress
so
that
I
would
have
her
kisses
for
every
booboo
that
made
me
cry
Six
to
six,
said
the
clock
over
the
booth
in
New
Yorkâ€™s
Grand
The
tall
young
Army
lifted
his
face
and
his
eyes
to
note
the
exact
time
His
heart
was
with
a
beat
In
six
he
would
see
the
woman
who
had
filled
such
a
place
in
his
life
for
the
past
13
month
the
woman
he
had
never
seen
yet
whose
words
had
him
one
day
in
during
the
worst
of
the
when
his
plane
had
been
caught
in
the
midst
of
a
pack
of
enemys
planes
In
one
of
his
he
had
to
her
that
he
often
felt
fear
and
only
a
few
days
before
this
battle
he
had
her
answer
Of
course
you
fear
all
brave
men
do
Next
time

doubt
I
want
you
to
hear
my
voice
to
you

the
Valley
of
the
Shadow
of
Death

no
evil
for

art
with
me

had
and
it
had

His
mind
went
back
to
that
book
he
had
read
in
the
camp
Of
Human
it
was
and
the
book
were
notes
in
a
woman
He
had
never

Her
name

Next
day

The

his

to
